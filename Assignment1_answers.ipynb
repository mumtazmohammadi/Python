    "1.\tIn the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",

    "2.\tWhat is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tString is a data type for a sequence of characters For example “Test” whereas Variable is reference that is created to refer     to a value in a program.\n",
    "•\tValue of string is fixed whereas the value of a variable varies.\n",
    "•\tExample of String is “Name” whereas variable can hold any value from string to integer dict tuple etc. example “New”, 132,       23.45, [1,2,3,3,34.5,”name”] etc.\n",
    "•\tVariable can hold a string but String cannot hold a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tDescribe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Three different data types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tText type : String is a data type for a sequence of characters For example “Name”. String in python is denoted in single quote (‘ ’)or double quote (“ ”) or triple quote (‘’’)  example: “test name” \n",
    "\n",
    "•\tNumeric data type : \n",
    "@Int : Integer or Int is a whole number positive or ngative without decimals of unlimited length eg 1, 3576687 , 598773988\n",
    "@float : Float or Folating point number is a number positive or negative containing one or more decimals eg. 34.56, 78.23, 89e3\n",
    "@complex : Complex numbers are written with “j” as the imaginary part eg. 3+5j, 5j\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tSequence type:\n",
    "@List : List are used to store multiple items in a single variable. List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. List has strings, integers, Float or Boolean values. List items are inexed as – first item - [0] the second item is indexed [1] eg. [“list”, “name”,23,45.66,]\n",
    "\n",
    "@tuple : List are used to store multiple items in a single variable. List items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values. List has strings, integers, Float or Boolean values. List items are indexed as – first item - [0] the second item is indexed [1] eg. (“list”, “name”,23,45.66,)\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tFloat: Float is a datatype used to store decimal numbers eg. 23.45 \n",
    "•\tBoolean: Boolean data type one of two values True or False. Its used to compare two values ‘True’ or ‘False’\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expression is a made up of operator and operands to perform mathematical , logical , bitwise or combination of operations.\n",
    "  For example a = 10 + 3 * 4\n",
    "\n",
    "* Expression performs mathematical logical bitwise or combinational operations on data provided to return a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   A statement is an instruction that the Python interpreter can execute whereas An expression is a combination of values,          variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "   bacon = 22\n",
    "   bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "   Answer : bacon contains value '22'\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam' \n",
    "  \n",
    "   Answer: 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "  Answer: 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ) as '100' are a numeric characters which cannot be made a variable name.Whereas 'eggs' are alpha characters hence its a valid variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "int(), float(), and str() functions are used respectively to get the integer,floating-point number, or string version of a value. \n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Error \"can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str\" for this expression.This is caused because strings only can be concatinated but not integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be corrected as following : 'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
